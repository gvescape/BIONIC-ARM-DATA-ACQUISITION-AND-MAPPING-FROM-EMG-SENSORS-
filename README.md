# BIONIC-ARM-DATA-ACQUISITION-AND-MAPPING-FROM-EMG-SENSORS-

This work emphasises on the capture of muscle signals at the amputated end of an amputee using EMG (electromyographic) sensors and other possible sensors; and mapping of these sensor outputs to the corresponding hand movements associated with them

Note : This work is as part of my mini project during my Bachelors
